# 🌡️ Weather Heatmap Generator

This is a simple project that creates a **weather heatmap** using:

- ✅ HTML & CSS for layout and styling
- ✅ JavaScript for interactivity
- ✅ C++ for backend logic 

Users can enter temperatures in a table, and the page will display a heatmap with color-coded cells based on the temperature.
